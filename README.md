🧠 Semantic Heatmap Tool — Overview

The Semantic Heatmap Tool visualizes patterns of meaning and coherence across large text corpora (e.g., Qur’anic, Biblical, and Hadith sources).
It combines computational linguistics, semantic similarity metrics, and visual analytics to map where and how texts overlap, diverge, or shift in meaning.

🔍 Core Features

Semantic Similarity Analysis: Calculates lexical and contextual coherence between verses, hadiths, or textual segments using transformer-based embeddings.

Dynamic Heatmaps: Interactive color-coded matrices showing intensity and distribution of semantic relationships.

Comparative Mode: Cross-textual comparison between corpora (e.g., Qur’an ↔ Bible ↔ Hadith).

Filtering & Clustering: Identify recurring concepts, metaphors, or interpretative patterns.

Export & Integration: Supports TSV/JSON export and API endpoints for integration with the Hadith Analyzer or other DH pipelines.

🎯 Purpose

The tool is designed for computational hermeneutics — to bridge quantitative metrics and interpretive scholarship.
It allows researchers to see meaning structures rather than just read them, providing a foundation for machine-assisted hermeneutic reasoning.
